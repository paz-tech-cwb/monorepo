# Changes

## Changed files

- `backend/package.json` — added production scripts for running compiled TypeORM migrations and then starting the API.
- `backend/Dockerfile` — changed container command from direct Node startup to `npm run start:prod:migrate`.
- `.ai/features/deployment.md` — documented that production backend containers run pending migrations before serving.
- `.pipeline/*` — updated ship pipeline handoff for this fix.

## Behavior changes

- Backend production containers now run pending TypeORM migrations before starting `dist/src/main.js`.
- Pending migration `1784073600000-AddUserAddressDetails` will add `addresses.number`, `addresses.complement`, and `addresses.neighborhood` in environments where it has not run yet.
- `POST /api/users` can insert address details without failing on missing `addresses.number` once the updated container starts successfully.

## Docs updated

- `.ai/features/deployment.md`

## Migration/deployment notes

- No new migration was added; the existing migration already covers the missing columns.
- Deployment must rebuild/redeploy the backend image so the new Docker command runs.
- If multiple backend replicas are started simultaneously, TypeORM migration locking/metadata handles already-applied migrations; prefer rolling out with a single backend replica during migration if the hosting setup allows it.

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding an explicit deployment job/service for migrations if the platform grows beyond a single backend container pattern.
